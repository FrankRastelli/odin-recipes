    <h4>Pesto Pasta</h4>
    <p>This is one of my absolute favorite dishes to make. This basil pesto pasta is super quick and easy to make, and only requires a few simple ingredients.</p>
    <p>I could literally make and eat this every day and be happy, it is that good. It's great as a side dish to a filet of salmon, but it's more than worthy of being the main course at the dinner table.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Pine nuts</li>
        <li>Freshly grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add pine nuts, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to food processor and combine</li>
        <li>Add basil and combine</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and parmesan cheese and combine</li>
        <li>That's it! Add to pasta and enjoy!</li>
